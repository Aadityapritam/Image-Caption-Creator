Image captioning is important for many reasons. For example, they can be used for automatic image indexing. Image indexing is important for Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) and therefore, it can be applied to many areas, including biomedicine, commerce, the military, education, digital libraries, and web searching. Social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter can directly generate descriptions from images. The descriptions can include where we are (e.g., beach, cafe), what we wear and importantly what we are doing there. 
 
Image Captioning is the process of generating textual description of an image. It uses both Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision to generate the captions.  Early image description generation methods aggregate image information using static object class libraries in the image and modeled using statistical language models. The image description is obtained by predicting the most likely nouns, verbs, scenes, and prepositions that make up the sentence. The Caption Creator System propose using a deep learning to detect objects in an image, classifying each image region and processing it by a prepositional relationship function and finally applying a conditional random field  prediction image tag to generate a natural language description using LSTM. 
 
This project is done using Python, Deep Learning, NLP and HTML, CSS, BootStrap as frontend and FLASK-Framework for the connectivity. The project Caption Creator System helps to analyses image and provide useful information or caption by analyzing image.
